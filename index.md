&emspCovid in New York City has had a great socio-economic impact on our lives. Analysing Covid death, case and hospitalization counts and understanding the movement of Covid throughout the city and each propspective borough can be a powerful tool and informative science to help minimize some of these metrics. One of the areas that I thought would be affect during covid was public saftey and police prescene due to the fact of quarantine. How did Covid affect crime and police activity and is there at all a correlation. Initially, I thought there would be as quarantine slowly was not being followed while governemnt positions were forced to be quarantine could crime sky rocket during the pandemic? Using sklearn, pandas, and visualization tools such as matplotlib, we can begin to see trend.
